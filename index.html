      I am primarily a computer scientist who specialises in AI (please see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/munkhtulga-battogtokh/">LinkedIn</a> profile for my full set of academic and work achievements).
      However, I am also interested in all kinds of topics that enrich our lives such as arts, sports, culture, and science. 
      The projects below are examples of my work that stem from my fascination with these.

            The Waterfall technique is a time-efficient memorization method for learners, which allows you to minimize the time spent 
            on easy items so you can focus more on the difficult ones. Traditionally, it involves the tedious task of preparing decks of flashcards,
            which is not possible to do without the right kit and environment, or buying decks, which are hardly ever tailored to your needs.
            This app allows you to create and use your decks digitally anytime anywhere and also to use decks created by other users.

            <p class="card-text">
              AI is a revolutionary technology that is yet to mature.
              Its existential threat alone forces us to rethink everything we thought we knew.
              Its ever-growing impact on individuals and society must be well-understood.
              Its all-encompassing nature requires an immense amount of continuous and collaborative human effort for safeguarding all its applications.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
              Personally, I study Artifical Intelligence to study intelligence itself.
              I am fascinated by how much we take both the brilliance and the bad biases of our intelligence for granted. 
              When inventing a new kind of intelligence surpassing our own, how do we make it work for us and how can we improve ourselves? I believe these are questions that <em>must</em> be addressed.

            <p class="card-text">
              I would like to leave a long-lasting and positive impact on people's lives. 
              One way to do that for sure is to educate. Regardless of how and where, a human life is not possible without learning.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, it can be really difficult. Personally, I am extremely thankful to the people who made efforts to make learning easier and fun for me.
              It would have been simply impossible for me to come this far without them. 
              That is why I believe it is important to provide support to those who are willing to learn.
            </p>

            <p>
              After first-hand experience, I believe storytelling is the best tool for learning. Animations, films, and games are all things that I have enjoyed so much growing up. 
              These are under-exploited in education as they are and with the advent of technologies like AI personalisation, dialogue system, and VR, I am invested into the future of learning.

            <p class="card-text">
              I cannot always tell what is the "right" thing to do. But I do know that being alive is a prerequisite to doing anything in the first place.
              We are always at the mercy of nature when it comes to survival. Therefore, it is nobody's interest but our own to ensure sustainability.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
              Sustainability is deeply personal to me. It is embedded into the nomadic traditions of my home country Mongolia, the loss of which has hurt families, including my own. 
              Many have bent to modernization. Some have broken in the sudden change. As we know, the change is global and to the most of us, it is sudden.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
              This is why I am interested in both slowing down the change and helping people adapt.

            <p class="card-text">
              Items that once took months to be delivered by camel caravans and horsebacks along the legendary silk road,
              now take only an instant to reach across oceans and continents.
              Considering this context, teleportation itself sounds possible next...
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
              On a more grounded note, there is a lot more to exploit in our relatively newfound global connectivity.
              There are practically endless opportunities online in the borderless world of the ideal global digital economy.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
              Therefore, I believe it is an important work to build digital environments that enable everyone everywhere to thrive in the real world.
              I would like to work towards supporting those who deliver value to others while combating all forms of potential abuse (scams, misinformation, and harmful content).
